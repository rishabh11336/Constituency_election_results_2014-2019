# Constituency_election_results_2014-2019

### Problem Statement
**AtliQ Media** is a private media company and they wanted to telecast a show on Lok Sabha elections 2024 in India. Unlike other channels they do not want to have a debate on who is going to win this election, they rather wanted to present insights from **2014 and 2019** elections without any bias and discuss less explored themes like voter turnout percentage in India.  **Peter** is a data analyst in the company, and he is handed over this task of generating meaningful insights from data.
